# Supermarket-inventory-management-system-using-OOP

In this project, I have developed a Super market inventory management system that manages the stock, Human resource, transporation of products in and out of the market.

This project consist of several text files that stores the data about the stock, Human resource, product transportation, Login credentials of the system and one C++ source file that contains the main program. The user interface is designed in a very user-friendly manner eventhough there is no GUI involved in this project.
